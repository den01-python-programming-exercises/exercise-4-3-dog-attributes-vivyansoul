# Exercise 4.3 Dog attributes

In this exercise, you'll practice creating a class.

A new class can be added by creating a file called classname.py in the `src` directory and putting the code

```python
class ClassName:
```

at the top of the file. Name the class `Dog` in this exercise.

You have now created a class called `Dog`.

The class doesn't do much yet. However, practicing this step is valuable for what is to come.
